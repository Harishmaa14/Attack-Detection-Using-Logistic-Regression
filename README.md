# Attack-Detection-Using-Logistic-Regression
This module performs attack detection using a logistic regression model, starting with preprocessing and scaling of raw input features. The input data includes network-related indicators such as packet size, protocol type, login attempts, session duration, encryption usage, IP reputation, failed logins, browser type, and unusual access time. These features are first converted into a pandas DataFrame and then scaled using a pre-trained scaler to match the distribution of the training data. This ensures that the logistic regression model receives normalized inputs for accurate classification of potentially malicious activities. The preprocessing step is essential for maintaining model performance and reliability in detecting attacks in real-time or batch environments.
